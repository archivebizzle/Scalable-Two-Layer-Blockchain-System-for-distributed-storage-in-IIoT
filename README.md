# Scalable-Two-Layer-Blockchain-System-for-distributed-storage-in-IIoT
In this application, we are carrying out cryptography strategies which includes applying a technique called a calculation to plain text to transform it into something that will give off an impression of being babble to any individual who doesn't have the way to unscramble it. Here the client ought to enroll their subtleties and can login, henceforth they can ready to see the rundown of document put away in this application and the substance of the record can't see the client since it would be encoded when the record is transferred in this application. The client can transfer their intrigued record and can download with the entrance of administrator. While transferring the document is changed over completely to non intelligible code and the key too. The administrator is keep up with the subtleties of downloader and the uploader subtleties. Then the client can download the document of who intrigued with the assistance of decoded key.


While blockchain offers better network security, data privacy, and decentralization, the cloud provides high scalability and elasticity. Hence, cloud and blockchain together have the potential to create innovative solutions, in particular with a distributed cloud like Ridge Cloud.

Blockchain is a type of distributed database that stores data electronically in blocks and then creates a chain of these data blocks using cryptography. Blocks in blockchain are essentially information containers where data is encrypted and stored.

A block itself consists of several components, such as a block header and block body. Each block in the chain has a timestamp that shows the exact time the block was added to the chain, a cryptographic hash of the previous block, and stored data.

RSA Algorithm 

The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic system, which enables public-key encryption and is widely used to secure sensitive data. It is particularly useful for sending information over an insecure network such as the internet.

The algorithm was first published in the 1970s by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman (hence RSA). 

RSA generates two different mathematically linked keys – one public and one private. The public key can be shared with everyone, whereas the private key must be kept secret. 

Why? Well, only the private key can be used to decrypt the message or data that has been encrypted through the public key.


SHA Algorithm -

Hashing is similar to encryption, the only difference between hashing and encryption is that hashing is one-way, meaning once the data is hashed, the resulting hash digest cannot be cracked, unless a brute force attack is used. See the image below for the working of the SHA algorithm. SHA works in such a way even if a single character of the message changed, then it will generate a different hash.



We are using assymetric key system in which  uses two keys. One key remains secret—the private key—while the other key is made widely available to anyone who needs it. This key is called the public key. The private and public keys are mathematically tied together, so the corresponding private key can only decrypt that information encrypted using the public key.
